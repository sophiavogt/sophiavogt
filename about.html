    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> I am a fourth year political science and English student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. </p> </a>
    <p> I am concentrated in International Relations for my politcal science major, with particular focus on U-S China relations, and North East Asian politics generally. For my English minor, I am specialized in literature and mind, which looks at brdiging the gap between science and humanities to create a more complete understanding of the human experience </p>
    <p> I am planning on going to law school in the future! And would like to bridge my interests of political science, government, law, and technology in my career. Hence, why I am learning to code here, I think this can be a useful skill for the future. Perhaps cybersecuity? I am not sure, just trying to figure things out.</p>
    <p> In my free time, I enjoy going for long walks by the beach, curating playlists, thrifting, hanging out with my friends, playing tennis, running, and weight lifting. I also love to learn new skiils, which I often achieve via youtube videos. That is how I learned how to code this! I also have an interest in finance and am starting to become more educated on cyrpto -- potentially the future of globalized finance! I'd like to take some business classes.  </p>
    <p> Some goals for my life include having a nice house with my family, some pets, being really handy and knowing how to build a fix things, having a really nice garden, traveling a lot, and just generally enjoying my life. I wish to have a career that fulfills me on the day to day and gives me freedom to be happy.</p>
    <p> Thanks for reading all of this if you have made it to the end <3 </p>
